sshx lets you share your terminal with anyone by link, on a multiplayer
infinite canvas.

It has real-time collaboration, with remote cursors and chat. It's also fast
and end-to-end encrypted, with a lightweight server written in Rust.

Install sshx with a single command. Use it for teaching, debugging, or cloud
access.
